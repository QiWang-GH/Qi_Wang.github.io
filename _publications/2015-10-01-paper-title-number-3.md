collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'Utilized the OpenCV image processing library to capture images and construct face data. Based on the MindSpore platform developed by Huawei, designed relevant face recognition algorithms using the dlib algorithm. Achieved real-time image capture and face recognition, created a simple UI interface, and controlled components such as MLX90614, servos, and passive buzzers using Raspberry Pi 4B and Arduino UNO development boards to implement the face recognition access control system.'
